# Form Mockups – HTML & CSS Practice

This repository contains two form layouts developed as part of a frontend assignment focused on practicing semantic HTML, CSS Grid Layout, form styling, and responsive structure.  
Each mockup faithfully reproduces the original UI from Figma, with full credit given to the designers.
